== Overview
In this lab you will prepare dynamic inventory using inventory plugins to ping bunch of nodes. Following are the highlights.

* Collections
  . openstack.cloud
  . ansible.builtin
* OpenStack Auth file
  . /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml
* Login username
  . cloud-user
* Ssh Private key
  . $HOME/.ssh/${GUID}key.pem
* Execution Environment
  . ee-osp:1.1.0


[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform all of the lab instruction on `bastion` node as `devops` user.

=== Prepare Lab Nodes

. You need run following `Lab Manager` command to provision following nodes for which you will write a playbook.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab deploy -i bunch_of_hosts
----
+
NOTE: You can run `lab destroy -i bunch_of_hosts` in case provisioning fails and then re run above command to re deploy bunch_of_hosts.

. Following lab nodes will be available after lab deployment.
+

== In-Memory Inventory
Sometimes, You may need to create various instances which were transient in nature and had no existing details available to populate an inventory. So, In such situation, you can make use of Ansibleâ€™s ability to populate an in-memory inventory, using the `add_host` module, with information it generates while creating new instances.


=== List Instances
. To get any information from OpenStack cloud you must have cloud credentials. Cloud credentials are already stored in `/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml` file in your `bastion` node. So Let's try to get list of servers/vms/instances from OpenStack cloud using `openstack` command line tool as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ openstack server list -c Name -c Status -c Networks  --os-cloud=${GUID}-project
----
+

=== Configure Settings

. Let's do Ansible Navigator settings, While creating settings file you also need to make sure `/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml` file mount parmeters are set. As follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/in-memory-inventory
$ cd $HOME/in-memory-inventory
$ cat > ansible-navigator.yaml <<EOF
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    playbook: in-memory-inventory.yml
  app: run
  execution-environment:
    image: ee-osp:1.1.0
    pull-policy: missing
    volume-mounts:
      - src: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        dest: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        label: "Z"
    environment-variables:
      pass:
        - GUID
        - HOME
        - INTERNAL_DOMAIN
  mode: stdout
  playbook-artifact:
    enable: False
EOF
----

=== Build In-Memory Inventory

. To build In-Memory inventory playbook for OpenStack instances, You can write a playbook using `os_server_info` and `add_host` modules as follows -
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > in-memory-inventory.yml <<EOF
---
- name: In-Memory Inventory
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    guid: "{{ lookup('env','GUID') }}"
    home: "{{ lookup('env','HOME') }}"
    internal_domain: "{{ lookup('env','INTERNAL_DOMAIN') }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Collection instance info
      openstack.cloud.server_info:
        cloud: "{{ guid }}-project"
      register: instances

    - name: Build In-Memory inventory
      ansible.builtin.add_host:
        host: "{{ instance.name }}.{{ internal_domain }}"
        group: 
          - "{{ instance.metadata.AnsibleGroup }}"
          - osp_instances
        ansible_host: "{{ instance.private_v4 }}"
        ssh_private_key_file: "{{ home }}/.ssh/{{ guid }}key.pem"
      when: instance.metadata.AnsibleGroup == "hosts"
      loop: "{{ instances.openstack_servers }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: instance

- name: Verify OpenStack Instances
  hosts: osp_instances
  tasks:
    - name: Verify connectivity
      ping:
      register: output
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ output }}"
EOF
----

. Run playbook to build in-memory inventory as follows :
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator
----

== Cleanup 
You must need to destroy `bunch_of_hosts` nodes, before you move to other labs. Or, Reset in case, you want to redo the lab.

.Destroy Lab Nodes
. If you want to move to next lab then please run following `Lab Manager` command to destroy lab nodes.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab destroy -i bunch_of_hosts
----

.Reset Lab Nodes
. You can reset lab nodes if you want to re do the lab.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab reset -i bunch_of_hosts
----
