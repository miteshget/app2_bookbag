== Overview
In this lab you will be creating service account and configure account on multiple nodes so that you can automation the node using Ansible Automation Platform. Following are the high lights of the lab.

* Service Account
* SSH Keybased Authentication
* Restrict SSH Access
* User Privileges
* Host Subscription
* Automate Service Account Process

=== Prepare Lab
. You need to run following command which will create additional nodes in the environment for running lab instructions on them.  You can connect these nodes as per details given below -
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab deploy -i nodes
----

. Following are the nodes details and their credentials.
+
.Node Details
[%autowidth,cols="^.^a,^.^a",options="header"]

| Type | Value
| Username | cloud-user
| Password | r3dh4t1!
.2+| Nodes 
    | node1.example.com
    | node2.example.com
|===

+
IMPORTANT: Please pay attention to the lab instructions and execute instructions only on that nodes where you have been asked to execute.





== Service Account
In this section of the lab you will create, set privilege, configure secure authentication for the service usesr account. You will also do basic node configuration so that node can be automated. But all you will have do manually so that you can understand the use of service account. 

=== Understanding Service Account
Service user account is the user on Linux/unix platform which we use to connect node from remote location using ssh and will also have privilege to run specific or all linux/unix commands as sudo user. Recomended way for ssh authentication is key based authentication.

=== Create Service Account 
. You need to use `useradd` command to create user on `node1.example.com` as per following details.
+
.Service Account
[%autowidth,cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Type | Value
| Node | node1.example.com
| Service Username | devops
| Password | redhat
|===

+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh cloud-user@node1.example.com
node1$ sudo useradd devops
node1$ echo 'redhat' | sudo passwd --stdin devops
node1$ exit
----
+
NOTE: Enter `r3dh4t1!` as password for `cloud-user` when prompted.


. You can verify new service user account by login in node1.example.com as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh devops@node1.example.com
node1$ exit
----
+
NOTE: Enter `redhat` as password for `devops` user when prompted.


=== Configure Secure Authentication
SSH public key authentication improves security considerably as it frees the users from remembering complicated passwords. The ssh works with two separate keys which includes: *Public Key*- which gets copied to SSH server, *Private Key*- it remains with the user.

. To generate ssh keys, you can execute `ssh-keygen` command on `bastion` node as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh-keygen
----
+
IMPORTANT: Leave all the input options to default.

+
.ssh-key cli output
[source,textinfo]
----
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa): [ENTER]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [ENTER]
Enter same passphrase again: [ENTER]
Your identification has been saved in /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:otQAPntuqViPjU93GfG7ypytHL2GV4LXUAaOaMODZsc devops@bastion
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|  .       ..     |
| . . + . o  o    |
|  o = E o .o     |
|   = = o o.      |
|  . o o S..o     |

|  . * . +ooo     |
| o O . =.+oo     |
|. +.+   B=+      |
+----[SHA256]-----+
----

. By default ssh keys get generated in `$HOME/.ssh` directory. You can list keys as follows- 
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ls $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa*
----
+
.List output
[source,textinfo]
----
/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa  /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
----
+
NOTE: `id_rsa` is private key and `id_rsa.pub` is public key in the above output.

. Now, You will copy ssh public key in `node1.example.com` for secure authentication  in `devops` user's `$HOME/.ssh` directory, destination file name must be `authorized_keys`. You can perform these tasks using any command which you know. However you can use `ssh-copy-id` command line tool to make copy process easier. 
+
[source=text]
----
$ ssh-copy-id devops@node1.example.com
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,textinfo]
----
Enter password when prompted: redhat <1>
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'devops@node1.example.com'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
----
+
NOTE: Enter `redhat` as password when prompted

. You can verify ssh key based authentication as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa devops@node1.example.com
node1$ exit
----
+
IMPORTANT: You can notice, ssh command did not prompt for password if it asks which means you have missed one of the previous steps so re do them.


. You can optionally add following configurational parameter in `$HOME/.ssh/config` file in `bastion` node. So you don't need to pass all the ssh command line flags everytime you run ssh.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ echo ' 
Host node* 
  User devops
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ForwardAgent yes
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null ' |sudo tee -a  $HOME/.ssh/config >/dev/null
----

. To verify config parameters as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh devops@node1.example.com
----



=== Securing SSH Access
SSH provides a secure encrypted connection to remote hosts. If a user has a valid user account, then he can connect via SSH. However, as with any system regarding security awareness, there maybe a requirement to restrict certain users or hosts from connecting to a designated system via SSH. In this section, you will restrict root login and disable password based authentication on `node1.example.com`.

. You can disable `PermitRootLogin` parameter in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to disable root login via SSH.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh devops@node1.example.com
node1$ su - cloud-user
node1$ sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
+
IMPORTANT: Enter `r3dh4t1!` as password for `cloud-user` user when prompted.


. You can disable password based authentication to limit exposure to a brute force attack as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
node1$ sudo sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
node1$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
----


=== Adding User Privileges
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, there is program called Sudo, which is used to allow a user to delegate root privileges for a limited timeframe to users and log root activity. The term “Sudo” means substitute user, and do. Sudo used for managing of user permission based on a system configuration file. It allows users to run programs with the privileges of another user, by default, the superuser (root). 


. You can add following file with the content to enable sudo permission for user `devops`. This configuration will enable user `devops` to run all linux command with sudo and without prompting for sudo password.  
+
[source,sh]
----
node1$ echo 'devops ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/devops-service-account > /dev/null
----


=== Host Subscription
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription provides access to the RHN/Satellite content (RPMs). Subscription can be attached to system after you have registered your host. In this environment, you have your own Satellite and DNS server up and running, which you need to use the host.

. Below are details of satellite server running in your environment-
+
.Satellite Server Details
[%autowidth,cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Type | Value
| Server | satellite.example.com
| Username | admin
| Password: | r3dh4t1!
| Katello CA Certificate | http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
| Activation Key | gpte-labs-rhel8
| Organization | prod
|===

. You need to download and install satellite katello CA certificate to register host.
+
[source=text]
----
node1$ curl http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm --output katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
node1$ sudo dnf localinstall -y katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm 
----

. You can run following command to register and auto attach to subscription.
+
[source=text]
----
node1$ sudo subscription-manager register --org prod  --activationkey gpte-labs-rhel8
node1$ sudo dnf repolist
node1$ exit

. Assign sudo privilege to `devops`.
. Setup keybased authentication for user `devops`-
  .. Private key: `$HOME/.ssh/${GUID}key.pub`
  .. Public key: `$HOME/.ssh/${GUID}key.pem`
. Restrict SSH access-
  .. Disable root login.
  .. Disable password based authentication.


=== Create Project
. You will be doing all you work in the `$HOME/service-account` project directory in the `bastion` node.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/service-account
$ cd $HOME/service-account
----

=== Configure Ansible.cfg
. You cab create `ansible.cfg` file to as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > ansible.cfg <<EOF
[defaults]
collections_paths   =  ./collections
inventory           = inventory
EOF

----

=== Create Inventory
. You need to create static inventory to run playbook for the managed host `node2.example.com`, as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > inventory <<EOF
[nodes]
node2.example.com

[nodes:vars]
ansible_password=r3dh4t1!
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/${GUID}key.pem
EOF
----


=== Create Playbook
. In this section, You need to create ansible playbook as per point given above-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > playbook.yml <<EOF
---
- name: Play to automate process
  hosts: all
  become: True
  vars:
    service_user_name: devops
    service_user_password: redhat
    ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/
    ssh_public_key_name: "{{lookup ('env', 'GUID')}}key.pub"
    satellite_activationkey: gpte-labs-rhel8
    satellite_org: prod

  tasks:
    - name: install katello-ca-consumer package
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
        state: present
        disable_gpg_check: true

    - name: register system and attach subs
      community.general.redhat_subscription:
        state: present
        activationkey: "{{ satellite_activationkey }}"
        org_id: "{{ satellite_org }}"

    - name: Create Service User Account
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ service_user_name }}"
        comment: Service User Account
        password: "{{ service_user_password | default(omit) | password_hash('sha512') }}"
        state: present

    - name: enable sudo privilege
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: "{{ service_user_name }} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"
        dest: '/etc/sudoers.d/{{ service_user_name }}-service-account'

    - name: add public key
      ansible.posix.authorized_key:
        user: "{{ service_user_name }}"
        key: "{{ lookup('file', '{{ ssh_key_path }}/{{ ssh_public_key_name }}') }}"
        state: present

    - name: Disable root login
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        line: PermitRootLogin no
        regexp: '^ *PermitRootLogin'
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      notify: restart ssh

    - name: disable password based authentication
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        line: PasswordAuthentication no
        regexp: '^ *PasswordAuthentication'
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      notify: restart ssh

  handlers:
    - name: restart ssh
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
EOF
----

=== Collections and Variables
. You have to install following collections and set environment variables as you can see these has been used in the playbooks.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > requirements.yml <<EOF
collections:
  - community.general
  - ansible.posix
EOF

$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----


=== Run Playbook
. Now you can run playbook to automate `node2.example.com` as follows-
+
NOTE: You will execute `ansible-navigator` to run the playbook. You might be new for ansible-navigator so don't worry about the tool and it's flags. We will be discussing more about `ansible-navigator` in Developer Resources module of this course.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator run playbook.yml -m stdout --penv GUID
----
+
.Playbook Output
image:ansible_navigator_output.png[]
+
IMPORTANT: During the playbook run `devops` user will created and ssh password authentication will be disabled, As result `cloud-user` (cloud-user is configured with password only) will not be able to login on `node2.example.com`. So if you want to re run the playbook you will need to use  `-u devops` flag as follows `ansible-navigator run playbook.yml  -m stdout --penv GUID -u devops`.

. You can verify node2.example.com as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ssh devops@node2.example.com
node2$ sudo dnf install -y vim
----
+
.Verification Output
image:install_vim.png[]
+

== Cleanup 
You must need to destroy `nodes` environment, before you move to other labs. Or, In case, you want to redo the lab.

. You can run following command to destroy `nodes` environment.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab destroy -i nodes
