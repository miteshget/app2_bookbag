== Overview
In this lab you will write a playbook to deploy three tier app using collections created in earlier labs. Following are the highlight.

* Collections
. mycollections.threetierapp
* Roles
. mycollections.threetierapp.firewall
. mycollections.threetierapp.apache
. mycollections.threetierapp.haproxy
. mycollections.threetierapp.mysqldb
* Execution Environment
. ee-osp:1.2.0

[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform all of the lab instruction on `bastion` node as `devops` user.

=== Prepare Lab Nodes

. You need run following `Lab Manager` command to provision following nodes for which you will write a playbook.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab deploy -i threetier
----
+
NOTE: You can run `lab destroy -i threetier` in case provisioning fails and then re run above command to re deploy threetier.

. Following lab nodes will be available after lab deployment.
+
.Environment Nodes
[%autowidth,cols="^.^,^.^a,^.^a,^.^a",options="header"]
|===
| Sr No | Node | Inventory Group | Description
| {counter:cnode:1} | frontend.example.com | *loadbalancers* | This node will run haproxy as frontend server.
| {counter:cnode} | app1.example.com  
    .2+| *backend_servers* .2+| These two nodes will run apache as backend application server.
| {counter:cnode} | app2.example.com
| {counter:cnode} | appdb.example.com | *database_servers* | This node will run mysqldb as database server.
|===

== Deployment Playbook
In this section you will write a playbook to deploy `Three Tier Application` on the above nodes. You will be all necessary roles and playbook from `mycollections.threetier` collection (created in earlier lab).

=== Create Inventory
. You have already inventory file in the repository so you just need to replace ssh key name as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $HOME/three-tier-app-roles
$ sed -i "s/\${GUID}/$GUID/g" inventory
----

=== Create Playbook
. You can create `Three Tier Application` deployment playbook inside the collection as follows:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $HOME/three-tier-app-roles/collections/ansible_collections/mycollections/threetierapp/
$ mkdir playbooks
$ cd playbooks
$ cat > deploy.yml <<EOF
---
- name: Deploy database
  hosts: database_servers
  roles:
    - name: Install and configure firewall
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.firewall
      vars:
        firewall_services:
          - mysql   
    - name: database deployment
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.mysqldb

- name: Deploy haproxy
  hosts: loadbalancers
  roles:
    - name: Install and configure firewall
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.firewall
      vars:
        firewall_services:
          - http
        firewall_tcp_ports:
          - 5000
    - name: frontend deployment
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.haproxy

- name: Deploy apache
  hosts: backend_servers
  roles:
    - name: Install and configure firewall
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.firewall
      vars:
        firewall_services:
          - http
        firewall_tcp_ports:
          - 8080
    - name: application deployment
      role: mycollections.threetierapp.apache
EOF
----

. Create main.yml playbook which will import playbook from collection as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $HOME/three-tier-app-roles
$ cat > main.yml <<EOF
---
- import_playbook: mycollections.threetierapp.deploy
EOF
----

=== Ansible Navigator Settings
. You can create Ansible Navigator settings file with default name `ansible-navigator.yaml` as follows. 
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > ansible-navigator.yaml <<EOF
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    playbook: main.yml
    inventories:
      - inventory 
  app: run  
  execution-environment: 
    image: ee-osp:1.2.0 
    pull-policy: missing  
  mode: stdout 
  logging:
    append: False
    level: critical
    file: /tmp/threetierapp/ansible-navigator.log
  playbook-artifact:
    enable: True
    replay: /tmp/threetierapp/artifact.json
    save-as: /tmp/threetierapp/artifact.json
EOF
----

=== Push Content to Remote Repository
. Push all your work from local git repository to remote gitlab repository as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Re-useable Ansible Roles"
$ git push origin refactor-roles
----
+
NOTE: Enter `devops` as user and `r3dh4t1!` as password if prompted.


== One Command Deployment
After finishing all of the earlier steps you are good to do one command `Three Tier Application` deployment.

=== Running Playbook
. Simply execute `ansbile-navigator` command line to deploy `Three Tier Application` as follows. 
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator
----
+
.Playbook Output
image:playbook_output.png[]


=== Verify Application Deployment

. You can curl `frontend.example.com` to verify `Three Tier Application` deployment as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ curl frontend.example.com
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,textinfo]
----
---<Output Omitted>---
<form action="" method="GET" >
  Enter User Name: <input type=text name="name" />
<input type="submit" /></form></center></body></html>
----

. You can also open https://bastion.${GUID}.dynamic.opentlc.com:49210 URL in your browser to verify `Three Tier Application`.
* Enter `root` as user name.
* Then click submit button.
* If you see the output then deployment is successful.
* You can refresh page which switchs application between backend servers.

== Cleanup 
You must need to destroy `threetier` nodes, before you move to other labs. Or, Reset in case, you want to redo the lab.

.Destroy Lab Nodes
. If you want to move to next lab then please run following `Lab Manager` command to destroy lab nodes.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab destroy -i threetier
----

.Reset Lab Nodes
. You can reset lab nodes if you want to re-do the lab.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ lab reset -i threetier
----
