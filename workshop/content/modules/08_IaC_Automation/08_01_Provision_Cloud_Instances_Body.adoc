== Overview
In this lab you will automate instances provisioning in OpenStack Cloud. You will be writing a playbook which will provision cloud infra layer by layer. 


== Lab Requirements 
In this lab, you will write a playbook to provision OpenStack cloud instances. You need to make sure that you adhere to a high standard, good practice and consistency for writing the playbooks. Read the below given requirements and resources then provide solutions.

[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform all of the lab instruction on `bastion` node as `devops` user.


. You will use following resources to write playbook which are already available in OpenStack Cloud -
+
.Resources

| {counter:res:1} | Keypair | ${GUID}-keypair | OpenStack Keypair

| {counter:res:} 3.+^.^| Replace *${GUID}* with your environment guid. You can running `echo ${GUID}` to get GUID value.

. You will use following Execution Environment which you have build in earlier labs and Collection.

. You need to write a playbook in `$HOME/OpenStack-instances` directory to provision two OpenStack instances as per details given below -

== Hints for Solutions

=== Create Project
. Ceate `$HOME/OpenStack-instances` directory.
ifeval::[{show_solution} == true]
+
.Project Solutions
****
. You can use project directory as follows.
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/OpenStack-instances
$ cd $HOME/OpenStack-instances
----
****
endif::[]

=== Create Playbook
. Create `provision.yml` playbook and use `openstack.cloud.server` module to provision instances. FYI, `openstack.cloud` collection is already inside the `ee-osp:1.2.0` Execution Environment. 
ifeval::[{show_solution} == true]
+
.Playbook Solutions
****
. Create variables file for instances as per the requirements, as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > instances_vars.yml <<EOF
---
instances:
  - name: server1
    keypair: "{{ guid }}-keypair"
    image: rhel-8.3
    flavor: GLOBAL-CPU_4_Memory_8192_Disk_30_flavor
    security_group: "{{ guid }}-HostSG"
    internal_network: "{{ guid }}-default-network"
    metadata:
      AnsibleGroup: osp_instances
      deployment_name: dev

  - name: server2
    keypair: "{{ guid }}-keypair"
    image: rhel-8.3
    flavor: GLOBAL-CPU_4_Memory_8192_Disk_30_flavor
    security_group: "{{ guid }}-HostSG"
    internal_network: "{{ guid }}-default-network"
    metadata:
      AnsibleGroup: osp_instances
      deployment_name: dev
EOF
----

. You can create provision.yml playbook as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > provision.yml <<EOF
---
- name: Create OpenStack Instances
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    guid: "{{ lookup('env','GUID') }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Include Instance variables
      include_vars: instances_vars.yml

    - name: Create Instance
      openstack.cloud.server:
        cloud: "{{ guid }}-project" 
        name: "{{ instance.name }}"
        image: "{{ instance.image }}"
        key_name: "{{ instance.keypair }}"
        flavor: "{{ instance.flavor }}"
        security_groups: "{{ instance.security_group }}"
        auto_ip: no
        wait: yes
        nics:
          - net-name: "{{ instance.internal_network }}"
        meta: "AnsibleGroup={{instance.metadata.AnsibleGroup}},deployment_name={{instance.metadata.deployment_name}}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ instances }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: instance
EOF
----
****
endif::[]

=== Configure Settings
. Create Ansible Navigator settings file with default name `ansible-navigator.yaml` and add all necessary parameters. 
ifeval::[{show_solution} == true]
+
.Settings Solutions
****
. You can configure ansible navigator settings file as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > ansible-navigator.yaml <<EOF
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    playbook: provision.yml
  app: run  
  execution-environment: 
    image: ee-osp:1.2.0 
    pull-policy: missing
    volume-mounts:
      - src: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        dest: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        label: "Z"
    environment-variables:
      pass:
        - GUID 
  mode: stdout 
  logging:
    append: False
    level: critical
    file: /tmp/OpenStack-instances/ansible-navigator.log
  playbook-artifact:
    enable: True
    replay: /tmp/OpenStack-instances/artifact.json
    save-as: /tmp/OpenStack-instances/artifact.json
EOF
----
****
endif::[]


=== Provision Instances
. Execute playbook to provision instances-
ifeval::[{show_solution} == true]
+
.Provision Instances Solutions
****
. You can run playbook as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator
----
+
.Playbook Output
image:provision_instances.png[]

****
endif::[]

=== Verify Instances
. Execute `openstack` command line to get list of instances from OpenStack cloud and Make sure you have server1 and server2 in the list.
ifeval::[{show_solution} == true]
+
.Verification Solutions
****
. You can verify instances as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ openstack server list -c Name -c Image -c Status -c Networks --os-cloud=${GUID}-project
----
+
.Instances List
image:server_list.png[]

****
endif::[]


== Cleanup 

. In case, you need to delete instances which you created in this lab then you can run following commands to delete-
+ 
IMPORTANT: There is no need to delete until you want to fix something in instances. Because your newly created OpenStack instance will be used in next lab.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ openstack server delete server1 --os-cloud ${GUID}-project
$ openstack server delete server2 --os-cloud ${GUID}-project
----
