== Overview

In this lab you will install ansible plugins in previously build `ee-osp` custom Execution Environment and verify. Following are the list of plugins which you need to install.

* Collection
. community.general
. ansible.posix

[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform all of the lab instruction on `bastion` node as `devops` user.


== Adding Plugins Collections
In this lab you will be using `$HOME/ee-osp-build` directory which you had created and configured to build `ee-osp` custom execution environment in the previous lab. So you don't need to re do everything to build image from scratch. 

=== Add Galaxy Dependencies
. You just need to add following plugins collections in the galaxy `requirements.yml` file-
* community.general
* ansible.posix
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $HOME/ee-osp-build
$ cat requirements.yml
collections:
  - openstack.cloud
  - community.general <1>
  - ansible.posix <2>
----
Callouts
<1> Add community.general collection in the requirements.yml
<2> Add ansible.posix collection in the requirements.yml



=== Re Build Execution Environment

. After adding collections in `reuqirements.yml`, You just need to re run `ansible-builder` command as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-builder build -t ee-osp:1.1.0
----
+
.Build output
[source,textinfo]
----
File context/_build/requirements.yml had modifications and will be rewritten
Running command:
  podman build -f context/Containerfile -t ee-osp:1.1.0 context
Complete! The build context can be found at: /home/devops/ee-osp-build/context
----

=== Verify Execution Environment

. Let's verify custom execution environment image.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator images
----
+
.Steps to verify collections
====
. Type the *line number* of ee-osp image to get details.
. Then type *2* to get list of collections, Make sure you see all of the collection, which you have installed, in the list.
. To exit, keep on pressing <ESC> key until you are back to shell prompt.
====


== Using Plugins
In this part of the lab you will use `callback` plugins which was installed in the image from the collections. To use plugins you will create ansible.cfg, ansible-navigator.yaml and simple ansible playbook.

=== Create ansible.cfg
. You can create `ansible.cfg` to use callback plugins as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/test-plugins
$ cd $HOME/test-plugins
$ cat > ansible.cfg <<EOF
[defaults]
callbacks_enabled = ansible.posix.timer, ansible.posix.profile_tasks
EOF
----


=== Create Playbook
. You can create simple playbook to test plugins as follows-
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > playbook.yml <<EOF
---
- name: Test plugins
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    guid: "{{ lookup('env', 'GUID')}}"
  tasks:
    - name: Collect OpenStack instances info
      openstack.cloud.server_info:
        cloud: "{{ guid }}-project"
        server: "*"
EOF
----


=== Create Settings file
. You can prepare ansible-navigator settings file to use ansible.cfg and playbook as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cat > ansible-navigator.yaml <<EOF
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    config: ansible.cfg
    playbook: playbook.yml
  app: run
  execution-environment:
    image: ee-osp:1.1.0
    pull-policy: missing
    volume-mounts:
      - src: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        dest: "/etc/openstack/clouds.yaml"
        label: "Z"
    environment-variables:
      pass:
        - GUID
  mode: stdout
  playbook-artifact:
    enable: False
EOF
----


=== Run Playbook
. To run your playbook you simply execute following command and verify the output.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator
----
+
.Command Output
image:plugins_output.png[]
+
NOTE: Watch the output closely, This time replay has more infomation which is because of callbacks plugins.
