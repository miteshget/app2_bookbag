== Overview 
In this lab you will prepare a node to execute playbook using Automation Content Navigator as per following requirements -

. Installing Ansible Content Navigator
.. hi
. Explore Execution Environment
. Explore Inventory
. Run playbook
. Ansible Navigator Settings
* hi




[IMPORTANT]
You need to perform all of the lab instruction on `bastion` node as `devops` user.

== Installing Ansible Content Navigator

Automation Content Navigator (ansible-navigator) is new tool chain added in *Ansible Automation Platform 2*, It is a text-based user interface (TUI) which uses a container runtime and executes ansible playbook within the container. It has also various usefull subcommands that helps user to interact with the tool for executing and digging infomation.

. You can install Ansible Content Navigator (ansible-navigator) using Red Hat Subscription Management to register and attach to your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription. For your convenience node have all necessary repositories enabled. You can directly run `dnf` cli to install ansible-navigator package.

+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y ansible-navigator
$ ansible-navigator  --version
----
+
.Version output
[source,textinfo]
----
ansible-navigator 1.1.0
----


== Explore Execution Environment

By default Ansible Navigator (ansible-navigator) uses podman or docker (whichever it finds first) container runtime to execute Ansible playbook inside the container. It uses pre-built cotainer image to create execution environment which includes *ansible-core* along with a set of Ansible Collections. These container images get downloaded from registry.redhat.io when you execute ansible-navigator cli (it is completely possible to use your own container registry).

[IMPORTANT]
This default execution behavior can be disabled using *--execution-environment false (--ee false)* option. In this case, Ansible and collections must be installed on the system. 

To get ansible-navigator working you must need to authenticate `registry.redhat.io` registry otherwise execution will fail. For login, you can use Red Hat developer account. If you don't have developer account then you can create at following link https://developers.redhat.com/register.

. You can authenticate registry.redhat.io as follows.
+

[source,sh]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
Username: <enter your username> <1>
Password: <enter your password> <2>
----
+
.Login output
[source,textinfo]
----
Login Succeeded!
----
+

. After login you can execute ansible-navigator cli which will download default container image from registy and will show welcome page.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator

[TIP]
To exit from ansible-navigator (TUI), you can press <ESC> key or keep on pressing <ESC> key until you are back to shell prompt.

. You can list container images downloaded earlier using `podman` cli.

. You can explore image in details using ansible-navigator as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator images
----
+
====
. Type *0* to get details of ee-supported-rhel8 (primary) image.
. Then type *5* to get everything about image. However, there are separate numbers to get specific information of the image.
. To exit, keep on pressing <ESC> key until you are back to shell prompt.
====


== Explore Inventory
. You can veiw inventory content with Automation Content Navigator by passing inventory path to ansible-navigator cli.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator inventory -i /etc/ansible/hosts
----
+
.Ansible Inventory

+
Press 0 or 1 to browse groups and hosts. Press <ESC> to go back to previous menu or exit.


== Run Playbook

. Let's create simple playbook to check connectivity between control node and managed hosts.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/first-project
$ cd $HOME/first-project
$ cat > playbook.yml <<EOF
---
- name: Simple playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Check connectivity
      ping:
EOF
----

. When you run ansible-navigator, it automatically mounts user's `$HOME/.ssh/` and `project/present` directory inside the container execution environment. So, your ssh keys, playbooks and etc will be available inside the container at execution time. Hence, You can run playbook by simply executing following command.  

+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator run playbook.yml -i /etc/ansible/hosts
----
+

== Ansible Navigator Settings
In this part of the lab you will pass all of the arguments, flags, image, playbook, inventory and etc. through Ansible Navigator setting file. You will be using same playbook and other files which you have used/executed in earlier lab instructions. 

=== Ansible Navigator Settings file

Ansible Navigator settings file can be created in JSON or YAML format but you must have to use respective extension for respective format. Settings file name and path can be specified with an environment variable or it can be placed in project or home directory. The project and home directories can only contain one settings file each. If more than one settings file is found in either directory, it will result in an error.

. You can create Ansible Navigator settings file with default name `ansible-navigator.<ext>` as follows. 
+
[source,sh]
----
$ cd $HOME/first-project
$ cat > ansible-navigator.yaml <<EOF
ansible-navigator:
  ansible:
    playbook: playbook.yml #<1>
    inventories:
      - /etc/ansible/hosts #<2>
  app: run  #<3>
  execution-environment: 
    image: ee-supported-rhel8 #<4>
    pull-policy: missing  #<5>
  mode: stdout #<6>
EOF
----
.Callouts
<1> Specify the playbook name.
<2> Specify an inventory file path or comma separated host list.
<3> Entry point for Automation content navigator.
<4> Specify the name of the automation execution environment image.
<5> Specify the image pull policy. missing - Pull if not locally available.
<6> Specify the user-interface mode.

. Now you can execute playbook by simply calling `ansible-navigator` cli as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ansible-navigator
----
+
